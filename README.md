Repository with the code for the collaboration between Marco Ballarin, Riccardo Mengoni, Stefano Mangini.

It is composed as follows:

- In the `qnn_analysis/` folder we report the work relative to the pretraining of QNN using MPS devices
- In the `ent_char/` folder we report the work relative to the entanglement characterization of QNN architecture 
    using MPS techniques.


## Requirement

To properly run these code you need the following packages:

- numpy
- qiskit
- tn_py_frontend
- qcomps

The latter two packages are available from Marco Ballarin upon reasonable request
